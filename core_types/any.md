With that, we're almost done with the core types.

There is one more type, which we already saw, and that's the `any` type.

The `any` type is the most flexible type you can assign in TypeScript. This type doesn't tell TypeScript anything. It basically means you can store any kind of value in there. We got no specific type assignment. TypeScript will basically never yell at you when you use `any`.

Back in our code here, if I would set the type of `favoriteActivities` to `any`, I would not get an error. If I set it to an array of `any`, I at least tell TypeScript that `favoriteActivities` is an array of something. So if I would store just a single value there, I would get an error. But as long as it is an array, I can store whatever I want in there.

So, `any` is really flexible. And this can sound great at first, but actually, it's a big disadvantage, and you absolutely want to avoid `any` whenever possible. Because `any` takes away basically all the advantages TypeScript gives you. It gives you the same experience you have with vanilla JavaScript, where you also have the `any` type on everything, so to say.

`Any` basically makes sure that the TypeScript compiler can't check anything because if any property or any variable can store any value, well, then there is not much to check, right? So you can use `any` as a fallback if you have some value, some kind of data where you really can't know which kind of data will be stored in there and where you then maybe are using some runtime checks, like we did here, at runtime to narrow down what you want to do for certain values. Then you could go with `any`.

But in other cases, you really want to avoid `any`. If you have a chance of knowing which kind of data you're working with, be explicit about it. Let TypeScript inference do its job or explicitly set your own types. Don't fall back to `any` if you don't need to.
